Our Project The Temperature Measurement and Control system is used to measure and control the temperature. It has been implemented by using Atmega328 in a simulation software named SimulIDE using Embedded C. We can install this system in the vehicles to control the temperature in it. Each subsystem within an Electric Vehicle (EV) requires temperature monitoring. The Temperature sensor must be accurate at extreme temperature in order to protect system. Accurate temperature information allows the processor to temperature-compensate the system so that the electronic modules can optimize their performance and maximize their reliability no matter the driving conditions.This includes temperature sensing of power switches, power magnetic components, heat sinks, PCB, etc. Temperature data also helps to run cooling system in a controlled manner. The type of input sensor and signal needed may vary depending on the type of controlled process. We can done using the ATmega328 AVR Microcontroller and the temperature will be shown it in the LCD deisplay.
